Logbook Konni for OpenCPN
==========================
Important !!
if you used the preview <= 1.90 you MUST install the new layouts and select 1 or 2 engines in the Options-Dialog ! 

Building from source
--------------------
Please use Git for download and don't hit the downloads-link above to create a .zip or tar.zip !!
 
Clone the git repository to <OPENCPN_SOURCE_TLD>/plugins/LogbookKonni_pi (the _pi at the end matters!)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Optional -- clone the OpenCPN source files

You might choose to clone the OpenCPN source files directly from github or
you might choose to fork them, and then clone the source files from your
own fork.

To fork the OpenCPN source files go to https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN and
press the "Fork" button.  You will then be redirected to your own fork of
OpenCPN (which will be a URL like https://github.com/delatbabel/OpenCPN).

(2) Clone OpenCPN from github

If you forked OpenCPN on github as per the previous step then do this command,
replacing "delatbabel" with your own git user name:

git clone https://github.com/delatbabel/OpenCPN.git

Otherwise you can clone OpenCPN from its main repository like this:

git clone https://github.com/OpenCPN/OpenCPN

Either of these two commands will create an OpenCPN directory containing the
current OpenCPN source code.

(3) Clone this plugin from github

Again you might choose to fork this repository on github so you might
use your own git: URL instead of the one below.

cd OpenCPN/plugins
git clone https://github.com/delatbabel/LogbookKonni-1.2 LogbookKonni_pi
(the LogbookKonni_pi bit at the end is important)

or, from your own fork, a command similar to this (replace delatbabel with
your own git user name):

git clone https://github.com/delatbabel/LogbookKonni-1.2.git LogbookKonni_pi

(4) Make and build:

Run this commands:

cd ../build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target logbookkonni_pi
sudo make install

that's it.

Please post a note in the forum saying whether it compiles or not.

History
----------------------------

This is Logbook-Konni originally developed by Konni.  I have forked this from his git
repository and I am continuing development.  Konni has been unable to continue development
on this logbook due to ill health.
