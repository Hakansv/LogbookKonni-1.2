Allow timezones outside of UTC-12 to UTC+12. Probably out to UTC+14
because I think there are areas in UTC+13 that have daylight savings.

Save and display dates in local format, not always in the US
MM/DD/YYYY format.

Better handling of some incoming NMEA strings.

Log WIMDA and ERRPM nmea0183.  (May be in another version of the plugin).

Any others?
