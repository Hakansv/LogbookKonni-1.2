BEFORE YOU INSTALL THIS PREVIEW 
NEVER use logbook version 1.1 and the preview parallel (= two logbookicons in the toolbar) !!!

The logbookformat on the disc has changed. On startup all version 1.1-datafiles
are stored to a backup-folder 
(win 7 =  C:\ProgramData\opencpn\plugins\logbook\data\Backup_1_1)
and converted. 
Save the backup-folder AGAIN at a different location to have annother copy,
in case something went wrong !!
You'll be asked on shutdown the logbook or OpenCPN to restore the 1.1 files.


please click the help-button in the logbook-tab and read the help to get information 
about the new features and send me a bugreport.

This is a preview for the logbook version 1.2

New features:

- Date and Time-format can be changed in options by user
- 3 timers now
- individual watchlist
- statusbar for events
- new button help in logbook-tab
